KP's Photography Portfolio
==========================

A static website built using jekyll, compatible with GitHub Pages, sourcing photo galleries from Google Drive.

## Developing

1. You must have the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) version 2.0.0 or greater.
1. Get the bundler gem `gem install bundler`
1. Install the other dependencies from this repo's Gemfile `bundle install`
1. Run the development server `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml`
1. You should see some ouput including something like:
   ```
   Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/
   ```
1. Now go to <http://127.0.0.1:4000/> in your browser to see the site.

See the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for more info on developing a static site with Jekyll.
